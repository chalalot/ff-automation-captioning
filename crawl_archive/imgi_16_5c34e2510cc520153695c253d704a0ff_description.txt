The girl is positioned on a gray sofa, with one leg crossed over the other in a relaxed manner. Her outfit consists of a fitted, light blue sleeveless dress featuring a square neckline, complemented by a matching light blue headband in her long blonde hair. Her hands are delicately placed, one resting on her knee and the other on the sofa, conveying a tranquil and composed demeanor. She wears minimal jewelry, consisting of small earrings and a fine necklace, enhancing her understated elegance. 

The setting appears to be indoors with large windows that offer a view of lush greenery, suggesting a serene and pleasant environment. The lighting is predominantly natural, streaming through the windows to produce a gentle and diffused illumination. The sofa's dark blue cushions add contrast, and a small white handbag is placed at her side. The foreground presents a table set with dishware and floral decorations, completing the cozy and elegant atmosphere of the setting.
