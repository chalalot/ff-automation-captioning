The girl is sitting comfortably on a couch with her legs crossed. Her body features are not specifically detailed but she appears relaxed. She wears a light blue denim vest over a white lace top with high-waisted beige shorts. Her outfit has a casual fit with textures contrasting between the denim, lace, and fabric of the shorts. Her hair is styled in a loose, casual updo with a few face-framing strands. Accessories include layered necklaces and bracelets. She holds a mug in both hands, indicating relaxation and a casual setting. 

The background consists of a wooden bookshelf filled with books and framed photos, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly a living room. The lighting is soft and natural, probably coming from a right-sided window, which adds a warm and inviting mood to the image.
