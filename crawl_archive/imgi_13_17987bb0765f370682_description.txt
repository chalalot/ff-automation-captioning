The girl is in an outdoor campsite setting, sitting on a wooden picnic table. Her body is angled slightly to the side as she reads a book in her lap. She has a slender build and a casual, relaxed posture. She wears a light mauve sleeveless top, snug but comfortable, paired with light gray knitted shorts that tie with a drawstring. Her feet are adorned with white sneakers and ankle socks. Her long hair is styled in loose waves clipped at the back. Accessories include a simple necklace with a pendant. Her right hand holds the book open, with her left hand resting on her leg, and her legs are crossed at the knees. The background features tents and trees, suggesting a forest or park setting. String lights and a lantern on the table add warmth. The lighting is warm and soft, consistent with an early evening or late afternoon time frame, creating a cozy, peaceful mood.
