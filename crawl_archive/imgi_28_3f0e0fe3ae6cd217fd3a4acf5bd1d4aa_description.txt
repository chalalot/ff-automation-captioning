The girl in the image is positioned outdoors on a wooden deck, indicating an outdoor, garden-like atmosphere. She is clad in a cozy, oversized beige knit cardigan over a white shirt, with light blue jeans and cream-colored thick socks. Her hair is gathered into a bun using a scrunchie. She holds a mug in both hands, seated in a relaxed cross-legged pose that conveys tranquility and comfort.

The background includes a misty view of tall trees, suggesting an atmospheric, chilly setting consistent with autumn. The lighting is soft and diffused, likely from an overcast sky, casting an even light devoid of harsh shadows. Additional warmth is created by the presence of small pumpkins and lit candles arranged on a plaid blanket, contributing to a cozy, serene mood.
