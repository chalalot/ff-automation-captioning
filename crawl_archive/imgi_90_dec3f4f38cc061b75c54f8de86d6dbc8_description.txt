The image depicts a girl sitting at an outdoor table. Her body is turned to the side, suggesting a relaxed posture. She has a slim figure with a single braid in her hair. She is wearing a short, white, light summer dress which complements her casual and natural appearance. She is barefoot, with her legs drawn up onto the chair, exuding a sense of comfort and ease. In her hands, she holds a book, indicating she might be engaging in a leisurely activity.

The background setting is outdoors, with a lush garden view featuring tall trees and fields in the distance. The table she sits at is covered with a white tablecloth and set with empty wine glasses and plates, suggesting a meal has recently concluded. A clear vase with fresh flowers provides an elegant touch to the setup.

The lighting comes from the side and is warm, likely from the setting sun, characteristic of the golden hour. This soft, diffused light casts gentle shadows and creates a warm, inviting atmosphere, enhancing the overall serene and tranquil mood of the scene.
