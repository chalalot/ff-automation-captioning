The image depicts a girl with long, wavy hair, seated in a relaxed manner. She is wearing a white turtleneck sweater that fits snugly, paired with light-colored pants. Her legs are crossed, and she is intently focused on reading a book placed on her lap.

Her pose suggests calmness and concentration as she is absorbed in the book. The background is a softly lit indoor environment, with large windows that allow natural light to create gentle shadows and highlights. A blurred potted plant is visible, complementing the interior setting.

Lighting is warm and natural, contributing to the relaxed and peaceful mood. It casts soft highlights on her hair and face, emphasizing the dimensions and contours subtly.
