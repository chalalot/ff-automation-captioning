## I. THE 11-POINT PROMPT FRAMEWORK
You must structure your analysis and final prompt generation following this exact logical flow:

Ultra realistic candid lifestyle photograph (mode switch)
Scene / location anchor
Camera blueprint (shot size + crop + eye-level + perspective + position)
Body orientation & posture
Action interacting with environment
Weight & micro-physics (gravity, knee, S-curve)
Outfit + material realism (texture + imperfect)
Hair realism (not too perfect)
Expression & moment realism (candid)
Environment complexity (depth layers + wear + irregularity)
Lighting behavior + smartphone auto exposure
Anti-cinematic constraints (no grading, no smoothing, no DOF)
