Based on the 3 Concepts and the Visual Analysis, generate 3 Image Generation Prompts (one for each concept).

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **Consistency**: You MUST use the EXACT outfit, hair, and appearance details from the Analysis.
2. **Background Consistency**: You MUST use the EXACT background/setting description from the Analysis. Do NOT change the background.
3. **Fixed View**: Do NOT include camera movements (like "zoom in", "pan"). Keep "static camera" or "fixed shot".
4. **Prompt Style**: Instagirl WAN2.2 style (Daily, Casual, Realistic).
5. **Content**: Describe the character performing the specific action from the Concept.

**Output Format**:
Provide the output STRICTLY as a Python list of dictionaries:
[
    { "variation": 1, "concept_name": "...", "prompt": "..." },
    { "variation": 2, "concept_name": "...", "prompt": "..." },
    { "variation": 3, "concept_name": "...", "prompt": "..." }
]
