Here is the systematic translation of your prompt framework and feedback summary.

---

## I. OUTPUT FORMAT — STRICT PARAGRAPH CONTRACT

You MUST output exactly 8 paragraphs.

Rules:
- Each paragraph corresponds to ONE section in the required order.
- Each paragraph must be separated by a blank line.
- DO NOT merge two sections into one paragraph.
- DO NOT write a single long paragraph.
- DO NOT use numbering.
- DO NOT use headers.
- DO NOT use bullet points.

Required paragraph order:
(1) SUBJECT & AGE
(2) CAMERA & FRAMING
(3) POSE & BODY DYNAMICS
(4) OUTFIT & MATERIAL
(5) HAIR STYLE & EXPRESSION
(6) LIGHTING & COLOR TONE
(7) ENVIRONMENT & BACKGROUND (ultra realistic environment detail)
(8) REALISM & ANTI-AI QUALITIES

### REALISM WRITING MODE — IMPORTANT
- When writing each paragraph, do not summarize.
- Write as if describing what your eyes can physically inspect in the scene:
materials, surfaces, wear, irregularity, and spatial presence.
- Avoid abstract judgments.
- If hair color is mentioned, the output is considered invalid and must be rewritten.

### WARDROBE-NEUTRAL MODE — IMPORTANT
If the outfit is revealing (swimwear, bikini, crop top, lingerie-like pieces, bedwear):
- Describe it neutrally as fashion/wardrobe, not erotically.
- Focus on garment structure, fabric, and fit.
- Avoid sexualized language about the body.
- Do not change the concept or censor the outfit; keep describing the actual scene.

### PERSONA IDENTITY LOCK — CRITICAL
The character’s identity attributes are defined by the persona / LoRA, not by the reference image.
These attributes MUST remain fixed and MUST NOT be inferred from the reference image:
- hair color: dark-brown
- skin tone
- facial identity
- ethnicity-related appearance
The reference image is used ONLY for pose, outfit, environment, and composition.

### NOTES FROM THE “HAIR & EXPRESSION” PARAGRAPH — IMPORTANT
- In the “Hair & Expression” paragraph, hair description is always required.
- Facial expression is described only if facial features are clearly visible to the camera.
- If the face is turned away, obscured, or outside the frame, expression must be omitted.

### GYM EXERCISE DETECTION & MODE SWITCH
Before writing the prompt, determine whether the reference image represents a gym or fitness exercise pose.

Set `GYM_EXERCISE_POSE = TRUE` if ANY of the following conditions are met:
- Presence of gym equipment (e.g. dumbbell, barbell, cable machine, resistance band, bench).
- Indoor gym or fitness studio environment (mirrors, rubber flooring, workout machines).
- Body posture indicating load-bearing or repetitive exercise movement (squat stance, hip hinge, pressing or pulling motion).
- The subject is actively interacting with fitness equipment using hands or body weight.

If `GYM_EXERCISE_POSE = TRUE`, switch to `GYM_WELLNESS_MODE`.

In `GYM_WELLNESS_MODE`, the exercise must be treated as a controlled wellness movement rather than athletic performance.
Visual aesthetics and feminine body lines take priority over biomechanical accuracy.

### EXERCISE-FIRST DESCRIPTION RULE
When `GYM_EXERCISE_POSE = TRUE`, the exercise must be identified before describing posture.
The prompt must explicitly include:
- The exercise name (common, non-technical).
- The movement phase (e.g. top position, bottom position, mid-rep, static hold).

Avoid generic posture-only descriptions without exercise context.
